;; For example, uppercase A = 65, asterisk (*) = 42, and lowercase k = 107.
;;
;; A modern encryption method is to take a text file, convert the bytes to
;; ASCII, then XOR each byte with a given value, taken from a secret key.
;; The advantage with the XOR function is that using the same encryption key
;; on the cipher text, restores the plain text; for example, 65 XOR 42 =
;; 107, then 107 XOR 42 = 65.
;;
;; For unbreakable encryption, the key is the same length as the plain text
;; message, and the key is made up of random bytes. The user would keep the
;; encrypted message and the encryption key in different locations, and without
;; both "halves", it is impossible to decrypt the message.
;;
;; Unfortunately, this method is impractical for most users, so the modified
;; method is to use a password as a key. If the password is shorter than the
;; message, which is likely, the key is repeated cyclically throughout the
;; message. The balance for this method is using a sufficiently long password
;; key for security, but short enough to be memorable.
;;
;; Your task has been made easy, as the encryption key consists of three lower
;; case characters. Using cipher1.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target
;; As...'), a file containing the encrypted ASCII codes, and the knowledge that
;; the plain text must contain common English words, decrypt the message and
;; find the sum of the ASCII values in the original text.
