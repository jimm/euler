;; A permutation is an ordered arrangement of objects. For example, 3124 is one
;; possible permutation of the digits 1, 2, 3 and 4. If all of the permutations
;; are listed numerically or alphabetically, we call it lexicographic order.
;; The lexicographic permutations of 0, 1 and 2 are:
;;
;; 012   021   102   120   201   210
;;
;; What is the millionth lexicographic permutation of the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,
;; 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9?
