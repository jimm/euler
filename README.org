* Project Euler Solutions

This project contains my code for [[http://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] problem solutions. I started
off using [[http://www.erlang.org/][Erlang]], but have switched to [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]].

I'm not sure if that image, which seems to get cached by Github, is kept up
to date. If not, and if you care, you can visit http://www.jimmenard.com/ to
see my most current score.

The solutions are in functions named "pN".

p54 (poker hands) is in a separate file.
