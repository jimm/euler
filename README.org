* Project Euler Solutions

This project containsk code for a very few [[http://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] problem solutions.
I started off using [[http://www.erlang.org/][Erlang]], but have switched to [[http://clojure.org/][Clojure]]. Other solutions
are scattered in other repos. I should probably consolidate them.

The solutions are in functions named "pN".

p54 (poker hands) is in a separate file.
