;; In the card game poker, a hand consists of five cards and are ranked, from
;; lowest to highest, in the following way:
;;
;; - High Card :: Highest value card.
;; - One Pair :: Two cards of the same value.
;; - Two Pairs :: Two different pairs.
;; - Three of a Kind :: Three cards of the same value.
;; - Straight :: All cards are consecutive values.
;; - Flush :: All cards of the same suit.
;; - Full House :: Three of a kind and a pair.
;; - Four of a Kind :: Four cards of the same value.
;; - Straight Flush :: All cards are consecutive values of same suit.
;; - Royal Flush :: Ten, Jack, Queen, King, Ace, in same suit.
;;
;; The cards are valued in the order:
;; 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace.
;;
;; If two players have the same ranked hands then the rank made up of the
;; highest value wins; for example, a pair of eights beats a pair of fives (see
;; example 1 below). But if two ranks tie, for example, both players have a
;; pair of queens, then highest cards in each hand are compared (see example 4
;; below); if the highest cards tie then the next highest cards are compared,
;; and so on.
;;
;; Consider the following five hands dealt to two players:
;;
;; | Hand | Player 1                                           | Player 2                                            | Winner   |
;; |------+----------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+----------|
;; |    1 | 5H 5C 6S 7S KD (Pair of Fives)                     | 2C 3S 8S 8D TD (Pair of Eights)                     | Player 2 |
;; |    2 | 5D 8C 9S JS AC (Highest card Ace)                  | 2C 5C 7D 8S QH (Highest card Queen)                 | Player 1 |
;; |    3 | 2D 9C AS AH AC (Three Aces)                        | 3D 6D 7D TD QD (Flush with Diamonds)                | Player 2 |
;; |    4 | 4D 6S 9H QH QC (Pair of Queens, Highest card Nine) | 3D 6D 7H QD QS (Pair of Queens, Highest card Seven) | Player 1 |
;; |    5 | 2H 2D 4C 4D 4S (Full House With Three Fours)       | 3C 3D 3S 9S 9D (Full House with Three Threes)       | Player 1 |
;;
;; The file poker.txt contains one-thousand random hands dealt to two
;; players. Each line of the file contains ten cards (separated by a single
;; space): the first five are Player 1's cards and the last five are Player 2's
;; cards. You can assume that all hands are valid (no invalid characters or
;; repeated cards), each player's hand is in no specific order, and in each
;; hand there is a clear winner.
;;
;; How many hands does Player 1 win?
